# Car_Recommendation_System
Car Recommendation System — End-to-End Analytics &amp; ML Project using Python (Jupyter Notebook), CSV data processing, and Power BI visualization.

📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to help users find the most suitable car based on preferences such as:

Price
Mileage
Car type
Engine performance
Fuel type
Brand
The system uses feature similarity to recommend the closest matching cars.

🗂️ Dataset

Format: .csv
Contains car features such as model, mileage, price, power, seats, fuel, transmission, etc.
Used for preprocessing, EDA, and model building.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Jupyter Notebook)	Data cleaning, EDA, ML model
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn	Feature engineering & similarity model
CSV Dataset	Source data
Power BI (.pbix)	Visual dashboard for recommendations
Matplotlib/Seaborn	Data visualization.

🔍 Modeling Approach
The recommendation system uses:

✔ Content-Based Filtering
✔ Cosine Similarity / Nearest Neighbors
✔ Feature vectorization of numeric & categorical variables
✔ Ranking cars based on similarity score
